# Lk-objekte-klassen

The "lk-objekte-klassen" project is a project designed to test and evaluate your comprehension of objects and classes in Java programming. 
It presents a series of questions and exercises that assess your ability to create and manipulate objects, define classes, and implement inheritance and polymorphism concepts. 
By completing this project, you can gain a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming principles in Java and reinforce your knowledge of these fundamental concepts.
